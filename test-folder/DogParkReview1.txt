Prototype A
1.
	* "Where" wanted to input city/state - not zipcode
	* Slight confusion around "within" - mentioned date range
	

	Ease = 2
	Satisfaction = 4

2.
	* Went to learning and wanted to click search to search through all three categories
	* Didn't understand the "Learning" categories fully (i.e. Differences?)  

	Ease = 2 (Could be smoother, but it's still easy)
	Satisfaction = 5
3.

	* "Leave Feedback" confusion
	* Went to service reviews/profile first and wanted to leave feedback there.
	* Sub-services Menu First: Professional or Personal
	* Suggested leaving new feedback based on whether service exists or not.

	Ease = 2 (It could be easier based on suggestions though)
	Satisfaction = 4

4. 
	* Why two searches in events?
	* Address = Louisville Community Park
	* Date and Time should be separate

2. 
	* Enjoys the simpler names of the learning category - User's Tips
	* Doesn't care about time frame - unecessary with rating

	Satisfaction = 4

3.

	* Doesn't need top
	* Instead of empty stars, "Leave Review" with Ratings

	Satisfaction = 5

4.

	* How many people can attend?
	* Tags?

After after session:

	* Prototype B - He likes the visual aspects and style, instead of just text. Some of the search was also more specific. Wanted to clarify prototype A was still good too though.

	* Thinks it could be more inclusive, but doesn't feel like there's anything too particularly wrong with it or needing change.

	* Really likes the fact that it's an all-purpose app for your dog - that it has a wide spectrum of features for your dog.

	* Thinks that the app really has everything covered

	* Search for DogParks. Can I bring my dog somewhere? Dog-friendly locations.
