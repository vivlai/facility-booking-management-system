Prototype A

1.
	* First inclination was to go to search invitations
	* Didn't See Search Initially
	* Where = Boulder (Auto-generating CO)
	* My own observation - why when and within?
	* Combine invitations

	Ease = 3
	Satisfaction = 4

2. 
	* Weird categories
	* Professional articles -> Articles, User Tips -> Tips...simplify
	

	Ease = 1
	Satisfaction = 4

3.
	* Why is leave feedback covering services - should be separate
	* Seems like you should search for a service first and then leave feedback
	* Should be in service, with a separate avenue for unreviewed companies

	Ease = 3
	Satisfaction = 3

4.

	* Park Name, not specific, would like to have auto-fill
	* 5:00pm 11/8 - should be separate
	
	Ease = 3
	Satisfaction = 3

5.

	Satisfaction = 4

2.
	* Why time frame? Not necessary
	
	Ease = 2
	Satisfaction = 4
	
3. 
	* Separate "Leave Feedback"

	Ease = 2
	Satisfaction = 4

4.
	* No Feedback

	Ease = 2
	Satisfaction = 3

5.

	Search was completed in feedback

Follow Up

	Ease = 2
	Satisfaction = 3
	Use Again = 5
	Recommend = 5

	* Likes both for different reasons - A because of its simplicity and B for the extra stuff and UI.

	* Nothing in particular disliked
	
	* Creating events and attend nearby events is great. Would like to look up dog park too.

	* Nothing in particular to change

	* Cool to link to products for dogs
